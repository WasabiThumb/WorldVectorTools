# WorldVectorTools
An add on for popular Source Engine sandbox Garry's Mod, originally created as a modification for Valve original Half-Life 2. The addon became standalone and massed a great community.

Anywho, World Vector Tools contains two addons;
-SSP (Simple Spawn Points)
     -Allows for ingame setting of player spawn points, which remain between sessions per world.
-SS (Simple Spawner)
     -Creates entity spawners during game sessions with two simple commands.
     
COMMAND LIST
ssp_add
ssp_clear
ss_add <entity> <interval>

TODO LIST
Create more customizable spawns and spawnpoints (like launching players upwards or forwards when spawning, light effects, etcetera).

Clean up code redundancies, problems, and inneficiencies.

More soon.
